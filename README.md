# LSTM_autoencoder
This repo has a simple auto encoder for time series. The important point being the code has provisions for multidimensional as well as time series of varying length. 

## Why recurrent neural networks for encoding?
1. Leverage temporal data.
2. Variable sequence length.
3. Time series can be non stationary.

##Dataset
THe entire dataset repository can be downloaded from http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/ . It contains the ECG5000 dataset being used for testing.
