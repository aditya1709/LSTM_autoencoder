# LSTM_autoencoder
This repo has a simple auto encoder for time series. The important point being the code has provisions for multidimensional as well as time series of varying length. 

#Why recurrent neural networks for encoding?
Leverage temporal data.
Variable sequence length.
Time series can be non stationary.
